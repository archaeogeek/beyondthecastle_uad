## Non-Spatial REST

Non-Spatial RESTful services are provided by [ArrestDB](https://github.com/alixaxel/ArrestDB) and can be accessed at [http://lancasteruad.oxfordarchaeology.com/rest/index.php](http://lancasteruad.oxfordarchaeology.com/rest/index.php). To access a particular table, use the form:

    http://lancasteruad.oxfordarchaeology.com/rest/index.php/tablename

See [https://github.com/alixaxel/ArrestDB](https://github.com/alixaxel/ArrestDB) for information on how to use this.

You can get information on, or query the following tables in the database:

###Spatial###

Note that querying the spatial data using rest will display the geometry of the table or record in well-known binary format.

* **cellars**: dataset of Lancaster Buildings showing presence or absence of cellars - point
* **studyarea**: study area boundary of Lancaster Urban Archaeological Database project - multipolygon
* **listed_polys**: boundaries of listed buildings - multipolygon
* **event_points_full**: dataset representing historic or archaeological events - point. The Image_Hyperlink column may contain hyperlinks to historic imagery.
* **event_polys**: dataset representing the outline of events such as archaeological digs - multipolygon. The image column may contain a hyperlink to imagery.
* **mons_point**: dataset representing historic or archaeological monuments - point
* **monspres_polys**: dataset representing definite monument outlines, eg extant or exposed by archaeological events - multipolygon
* **monsint_polys**: proposed outlines of monuments based on information from archaeological research, events and other information - multipolygon
* **geophys**: contour lines from geophysical survey - line (note this data has no attributes so might be best as base mapping)

* **tblMonumentDates** - lists different phases of use for a monument
* **tblMonumentPeriods** - lists periods in which a monument was extant
* **tblMonuments** - monuments
* **tbl_monuments_listed** - lists monuments that are listed buildings
* **tblParentEvents** - lists events that comprise multiple smaller events such as large-scale archaeological investigations
