# Overview of Interfaces

The following interfaces are available for working with the data from the Lancaster Urban Archaeological Database:

* Web Mapping Services (WMS)- useful for getting at raster-based layers, such as base mapping, for use in spatial applications
* Web Feature Services (WFS)- useful for getting at vector-based layers for use in spatial applications
* REST- useful for getting text-based information about database tables
* PGREST- useful for getting text-based information from spatial database tables, and performing spatial queries
